# Overview

## History
### Age of Creation
#### Origin of the Moons
During the [[Age of Creation]] seeing that her husband [[Deus]] had created the sun believed that the creatures of the earth should not be left alone in the dark at night. So she created the two moons [[Luna]] and [[Fengári]], and they were as her children. [[Luna]] and [[Fengári]] moved across the sky and each rested as the other shown bright so that the night sky may always have a source of light.
