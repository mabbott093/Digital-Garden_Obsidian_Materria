# Overview
From the mind of [[Primus Etundeus]] is birthed the [[Deorum]]; the [[Mietros]] and the [[Eietros]]. Together [[Primus Etundeus]], the [[Mietros]] and the [[Eietros]] sang in harmony a second song to create the universe. From the heavens above to the seas below, from the forests to the deserts, from the hills to the lowlands, and all the plains of existence and at it's center was the world of [[Materria]] (mother, material plane). All was made as intended by the god's song. When the song was done the gods looked over their creation and saw that it was good.

The world and universe was made but [[Primus Etundeus]] looked and it and saw that it lacked life. So he calls the [[Deorum]] together to sing a second song of creation. Together they created harmonious music and with [[Primus Etundeus]]' [[Crown of Fire]] he breathes life into every manner of creature from the birds in the sky, to the beasts on the ground, to the fish in the sea, and he saw it was good.
