# Overview
The world was now created and filled with life but it lacked something, someone with the free will to guide this new world and craft their own destiny. So [[Primus Etundeus]] and the [[Deorum]] sang a third song of creation to create man: human, elf, dwarf, and all manner of races of the world. [[Primus Etundeus]] gifted them unlike any creation before the ability to think for themselves, to reason, and craft their own destiny. Using his [[Crown of Fire]] he gave them a will of their own.

But [[Valdimar]], being the strongest of the [[Mietros]] wanted to sing his own song but he lacked the [[Crown of Fire]] which gave true life and free will to [[Primus Etundeus]]' creations. And so [[Valdimar]] instead began his song of corruption so he might bend the creations of [[Primus Etundeus]]' to his will and in doing so he introduced evil and suffering into the world. [[Valdimar]] enlisted the help of some of the other [[Eietros]]' to aid in his song of corruption. When [[Primus Etundeus]]' song of creation and [[Valdimar]]'s song of corruption were done the world had forever changed. Now all races of the world had innate within them life, free will, and the capacity of great good, or great evil.
